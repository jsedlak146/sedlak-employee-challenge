# Sedlak-Employee-Challenge

## Description

For this challenge, we had to create a program that would generate an HTML file with information about employees including their role, email, name and other information. For certain roles like engineer and intern, ther were specifics like the school they went to and their github username.  Managers also had to have office number included. Below are the links to my demo video and my Github Repository. My generated HTML file is within the "dists" folder.

## Installation

I began by running my npm to install Inquirer and Jest. After that, I built the four files containing the Javascript for Employee, Manager, Engineer and Intern.  This will create their profiles.  Next, I made four tests pertaining to each of the files and ran them to make sure that they passed.  After that, I built my index.js folder which contains all of my functions for running the application, as well as questions and answers.

## Usage

To use the application, open the index.js file in the integrated terminal.  After running the command "npm test", you will see the application passes all of the tests.  Next, enter "node index" in the command line and answer the following prompts.  When you are finished, select the "no, i am finished" option and check the dists folder for your newly generated HTML file.

## Tests

I tested the app using Jest.  I had four tests, one for employee, engineer, intern and manager. As you can see in the video it passes the tests.
